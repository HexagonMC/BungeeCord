BungeeCord for 1.7/1.8/1.9
==========
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/ghacproductions/BungeeCord.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/ghacproductions/BungeeCord)

This version implements a system to put several BungeeCord-instances "after each other". Just set ip-forward to true on all your BungeeCord-instances, then the player will have the correct ip and uuid on every server.
As all BungeeCord-commands can only be handled by one server (same command), a config option was added, called: command_prefix, defaults to '!'. This way several BungeeCord-instances can be managed in game.

This fork will be kept up to date with our other [fork](https://github.com/HexagonMC/BungeeCord)
